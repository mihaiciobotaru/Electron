# Electron

## Description

The project aimed to be accomplished is called ”Electron”. This
project consists of a graphical interface that gives the client the possibility to create, modify, save and load electronical circuits. Also the application has a theme and language menu and a hidden snake game. I have learned about SFML with the help of this project.

## Technologies used

For the graphical side of the project I decided to use SFML - Simple and Fast
Multimedia Library. SFML is a cross-platform library designed to provide simple
application programming interface (API) having bindings in C.

### Dependencies

* SFML 
* C++ compiler

## Authors

Ciobotaru Mihai (https://github.com/mihai2096)
Iulian Oleniuc

I've made the graphical interface, snake game, themes and language backend while Iulian has made everything related to the circuits.
